1. OLTP stands for On-Line Transaction Processing and focus on single transactions while in OLAP,
which stands for On-Line Analytical Processong, the focus is on analysis of the data. In OLTP
data may be updated, added or deleted, while in OLAP data is simply added, this is because,
in OLAP we want to analyze data and therefore need all "instances" (per say) of the data,
while in OLTP we only need the most recent "instance". This translates to the following,
OLAP is excelent to process huge amounts of data, while OLTP is excelent to process
very small amounts.
