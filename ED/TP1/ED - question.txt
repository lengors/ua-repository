Question: What is the average number of roads a taxi passes by during a day?

Strategy/Paper: Based on the paper "A Hidden Markov Model-based Map-Matching Approach for Low-Sampling-Rate GPS Trajectories" by
Yu-Ling Hsueh, Ho-Chian Chen, and Wei-Jie Huang map the gps coordinates provided in the dataset to the road map provided. After 
that iterate chronologically (for each taxi) through the mapped points and get the date and time that the taxi enters a road, and
the time it remains in that road. Store that information based on the multidimensional model. In the end use that information to
create the average number of roads a taxi passes by during a day.
