For this project premake was used. Basically, it generates compile configurations for a chosen compiler,
which means it can be thought as a unifying language for compiling configurations.

The premake's configuration is the premake5.lua file. In order to automate the building and running process
we made 3 scripts for windows, and 3 for unix systems, but they basically do the same thing.

The build script calls internally premake and then compiles the source code. The run script
looks for the right executable in the bin (binary) folder and executes it with the given parameters.
The reset script simply deletes all files generated by the build script.
