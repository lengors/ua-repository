For this project premake was used. Basically, it generates compile configurations for a chosen compiler,
which means it can be thought as a unifying language for compiling configurations.

The premake's configuration is the premake5.lua file. In order to automate the building and running process
we made 3 scripts for windows, and 3 for unix systems, but they basically do the same thing.

The build script calls internally premake and then compiles the source code. The run script
looks for the right executable in the bin (binary) folder and executes it with the given parameters.
The reset script simply deletes all files generated by the build script.

## BUILD ##
./build[.sh]

## RUN ##
FCM:
./run[.sh] fcm [k] [alpha] [text='test.txt'] [model='model.mdl'] [-p]
- k: context's size
- alpha: alpha
- text: the file's name of the text used to create the model
- model: the file's name of the file where the program stores the model
- option [-p]: prints data of the model and its entropy onto the standard output

GENERATOR:
./run[.sh] generator [-s max_size] [-t initial_text] [-o output_model_filename] [-p] [input_model_filename='model.mdl']
- max_size: max size of the generated text
- initial_string: initial string for the generated text
- input_model_filename: the file's name of the file where the original model is stored
- output_model_filename: the file's name of the file where the program stores the model of the generated text
- option [-p]: prints the generated text onto the standard output

COMPARATOR:
./run[.sh] comparator first_model_filename second_model_filename
- first_model_filename: the file's name of a file containing a model
- second_model_filename: the file's name of another file containing a model

## RESET ##
./reset[.sh]

## How to run a concrete example ##
1. First thing, execute 

	./build.sh

This will build FCM, Generator and Comparator.

2. Run FCM, 

	./run.sh fcm 2 1 t1.txt model_t1.mdl -p

This will create a model called model_t1 holding necessary information for the Generator. 
This model was created with k = 2 and alpha = 1. "-p" tells the program print out the entropy of the model, in this case is 5.02675.

3. Run Generator, 

./run.sh generator -s 100 -t \"I hope we get a good grade.\" -o new_model_t1.mdl -p model_t1.mdl 

The generator will create an output of 100 characters considering the initial text given.

4. Finally, execute 

	./run.sh comparator model_t1.mdl new_model_t1.mdl 

This program will a value which represents the similarity of the 2 files. The closer to 0 the value is, shows how similar both files are.
